# Description

<img align="right" src="./assets/img/homepage.jpg" width = "350" height = "200">
Our project Ikshana is a small step towards creating an environment where gender diversity is not only about tokenism of some kind but in its true sense uplifting to the concerned.
We have tried to provide a one-stop platform for the non-male population around us who are continuously under the pressure of living upto certain standards to be respected in the society, they often forget to look after their own well being.
Our vision is to make a safe, and cosy place to learn, explore and heal themselves.

Features of Our Website:

1. Gender spectrum awareness - We have added a feature where the anyone who is still exploring their sexuality can take a quiz to know on which spectrum they incline more towards.
2. Meditation Platform - Our meditation platform helps users relax.
3. Moode Based Spotify Playlist - Our mood base player plays music based on your mood
4. Period Tracker- Our period trackers gives you an estimated date of your next cycle. It also comes in with a all you need to know to keep yourself healthy during periods guide.
5. Pregnancy Tracker- Track your pregnancy alongside us and keep yourself updated.
6. Medication Reminder- We added a feature where the user is reminded of the medications they have to take.

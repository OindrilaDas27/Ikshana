        offers period pain relief to a great extent.</p>

        time do not overdo it. Exercises are known to release chemicals in your body called endorphins, which act as
        natural pain relievers. A few light stretches, yoga, or a brisk walk outside will work just fine as a period
        cramp relief.</p>

    <p>Ensure a balanced diet or look into foods to eat for a better period where you eat more vegetables and fruits,
        and reduce the consumption of fatty foods, for an easy period cramp remedy. Try reducing salt in your food, as
        excess salt intake encourages fluid retention leading to bloating. Herbal tea is warm and soothing, and in some
        cases may help in offering period pain relief.</p>

        you the required period pain relief. Calming your body causes your muscles to expand and loosen, rather than
        them scrunching up and causing cramps.</p>

        pain medicine. Be sure to always seek expert advice before taking any period pain tablets.</p><br>
